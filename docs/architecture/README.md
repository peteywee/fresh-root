# Architecture Documentation

High-level system design and decision records.

## Start here

- [System L0](./01_SYSTEM_L0_Bible.md)
- [System L1](./02_SYSTEM_L1.md)
- [Tooling Strategy](./MCP_TOOLING_STRATEGY.md)

## Notes

Architecture docs should stay high-level and avoid operational specifics. For implementation
details, use guides and standards.
