## Key Capabilities Demonstrated

### 1. Auto-Test Generation Pattern

The integration tests show how the system automatically generates tests by:

1. **Analyzing TypeScript source code** (AST parsing)
2. **Extracting metadata**:
   - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
   - Endpoint path
   - Required/optional parameters
   - Required permissions
   - Error cases
3. **Generating test cases** for:
   - Happy path (valid input)
   - Validation (invalid input)
   - Authorization (role checks)
   - Error handling (status codes)
   - Concurrency (race conditions)

### 2. Performance SLA Validation

Tests validate:

- **P95 latency** < 200ms (typical SLA)
- **P50 latency** < 100ms (typical SLA)
- **Memory stability** < 100MB growth under load
- **Throughput** > 10 req/s minimum

### 3. Contract Testing

Demonstrates:

- Response schema validation
- Request parameter validation
- OpenAPI 3.0 compliance
- Breaking change detection

### 4. Mutation Testing Quality

Shows how tests are validated by:

1. Introducing intentional bugs (mutations)
2. Running test suite
3. Measuring mutation score
4. Identifying test blind spots

### 5. Chaos Engineering

Demonstrates resilience to:

- Database failures (graceful degradation)
- Rate limiting (exponential backoff)
- Timeouts (retry logic)
- Cascading failures (isolation)
- Network partitions (offline-first)
- Resource exhaustion (load shedding)

## Technical Deep Dive

### How Auto-Test Generation Works

```typescript
1. File Discovery
   - Glob pattern: apps/web/app/api/**/route.ts
   - Found: 20+ API routes

1. AST Analysis
   - Parse TypeScript source
   - Extract: methods, params, schemas, permissions
   - Analyze: error handling, validation

1. Test Generation
   - Happy path (valid input)
   - Validation tests (invalid input)
   - Permission tests (role checks)
   - Error tests (status codes)
   - Concurrent tests (race conditions)

1. Output
   - Generated test files
   - Coverage report
   - OpenAPI spec
```

### How Mutation Testing Works

```typescript
1. Mutation Generation
   - Boundary: < becomes <=, > becomes >=
   - Arithmetic: + becomes -, * becomes /
   - Logical: && becomes ||, ! becomes identity

1. Test Execution
   - Run tests with original code (baseline)
   - Run tests with mutations
   - Track which mutations are caught

1. Scoring
   - Mutation Score = (Killed Mutants / Total Mutants) * 100
   - Score > 80% = Excellent
   - Score > 60% = Good
   - Score < 60% = Needs improvement

1. Reporting
   - Identify test blind spots
   - Suggest additional tests
```
