# Onboarding Guide

Choose the path that fits your role and depth.

## Path A: Product or stakeholder (non-technical)

1. Read the [Project Overview](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md).
2. Skim [Documentation Index](../INDEX.md) for key areas.
3. Ask for a demo or walkthrough from a maintainer.

## Path B: Developer (standard)

1. Start with [Quick Start](./QUICK_START.md).
2. Read [Coding Rules & Patterns](../standards/CODING_RULES_AND_PATTERNS.md).
3. Run tests after any change:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Path C: Developer (deep technical)

1. Read [Documentation Index](../INDEX.md) to map the doc set.
2. Review [Architecture](../architecture/README.md) for system context.
3. Use [Reference](../reference/README.md) for checklists and quick lookups.

## Path D: Operations

1. Review [Production Readiness](../reference/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md).
2. Follow [Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

## First-week checklist (engineers)

- Day 1: Local setup and test run
- Day 2: Read standards and make a small doc or code change
- Day 3: Pair review with a maintainer on a small PR

## Need help

Start a thread with a maintainer and share the path you followed.
