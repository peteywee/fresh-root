# Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Agent Self-Update (Exit Code 77)

**Status:** Working as designed

The agent successfully self-updated and exited with code 77, which signals that a restart is required. This is the expected behavior for the self-update feature.

```bash
[agent] [self-update] Checking for agent updates...
[agent] [self-update] Agent updates detected. Pulling changes...
[ok] [self-update] Agent updated successfully. Restarting...
ELIFECYCLE  Command failed with exit code 77.
```

**No action needed** - This is correct behavior. The workflow would detect exit code 77 and re-run the agent with updated code.

### 2. ✅ Docker Build Failure (Fixed)

**Error:**

```
ERR_PNPM_NO_OFFLINE_META  Failed to resolve execa@>=9.4.0 <10.0.0-0
This error happened while installing a direct dependency of /app
```

**Root Cause:**

- `execa` is a workspace root dependency in `package.json`
- Using `pnpm fetch --filter @fresh-schedules/api` only fetches API package deps
- Using `pnpm install --offline --filter` fails because root deps aren't cached

**Solution:**
Updated `services/api/Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Before (broken)
RUN pnpm fetch --filter @fresh-schedules/api
RUN pnpm install -r --offline --filter @fresh-schedules/api...

# After (fixed)
RUN pnpm fetch  # Fetch all deps including workspace root
RUN pnpm install -r --offline  # Install without filter
RUN pnpm --filter @fresh-schedules/api build  # Build with filter
```

**Commits:**

- `98528eb` - Initial fix attempt
- `0bc785c` - Final fix removing filter from install

### 3. ✅ Rules Tests Failure (Fixed)

**Error:**

```
TypeError: fetch failed
Caused by: Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8080
```

**Root Cause:**

- Firebase emulators (Firestore on port 8080, Storage on port 9199) were not running
- Tests require emulators to be active before execution
- Running `pnpm -w test:rules` directly doesn't start emulators

**Solution:**
Updated `package.json` to wrap tests in `firebase emulators:exec`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:rules": "firebase emulators:exec --only firestore,storage \"vitest run --globals --dir tests/rules --reporter=dot\"",
    "test:rules:dev": "vitest run --globals --dir tests/rules --reporter=dot"
  }
}
```

**Usage:**

```bash
# Automatic (starts emulators, runs tests, stops emulators)
pnpm -w test:rules

# Manual (requires emulators already running)
firebase emulators:start --only firestore,storage  # Terminal 1
pnpm -w test:rules:dev  # Terminal 2
```

**Commit:** `98528eb`

## Testing Instructions

### Build and Run Agent

```bash
# Build agent
pnpm run build:agent

# Run agent (will self-update if needed)
pnpm run:agent --issue 21

# Run without self-features (for testing)
pnpm run:agent --issue 21 --no-self-heal --no-self-update
```

### Docker API Build

```bash
# Build container
pnpm run api:docker:build

# Run container
pnpm run api:docker:run

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:4000/health
```

### Rules Tests

```bash
# Automatic (recommended)
pnpm -w test:rules

# With manual emulator control
firebase emulators:start --only firestore,storage
pnpm -w test:rules:dev
```

---

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) already uses `emulators:exec`:

```yaml
- name: Firestore & Storage Rules Tests (via emulators:exec)
  run: |
    pnpm exec firebase emulators:exec --only firestore,storage "pnpm -w test:rules"
```

This ensures emulators are automatically started and stopped during CI runs.
