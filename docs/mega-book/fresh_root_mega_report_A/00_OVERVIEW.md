# Fresh Root / Fresh Schedules — Mega Architecture Report (Level A)
**Version:** 0.1.0 (auto-generated skeleton)\
**Date:** 2025-12-30\
**Owner:** Patrick Craven\
**System:** Fresh Root Monorepo / Fresh Schedules PWA

This report is a **multi-file architectural book** generated to support:

- Deep technical analysis
- Refactoring and SDK extraction
- Reverse engineering of removed components
- Investor/partner facing explanations
- Future AI-assisted reasoning over the system

It is structured using the **L0–L4 hierarchical protocol** and the **9-panel expert model**.

---

## File Layout
- `01_SYSTEM_L0.md` — Mission & Non-Negotiables
- `02_SYSTEM_L1.md` — Global architecture, constraints, and cross-cutting concerns
- `03_SUBSYSTEMS_L2/` — One file per major subsystem (onboarding, scheduling, labor, RBAC, etc.)
- `04_COMPONENTS_L3/` — Detailed components: APIs, collections, React modules, functions
- `05_TASKS_L4/` — Ordered remediation plans and refactor roadmaps
- `06_SDK_DEPRECATION_LEDGER/` — Mapping from removed code → stable SDKs
- `99_APPENDICES/` — Glossary, data models, risk register, references

Each file is designed to be **machine-readable** (for AI tools) and **human-usable** (for you and future collaborators).
