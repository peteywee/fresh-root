# L2 — RBAC / Security / Access Control

> **Status:** Skeleton generated.  
> This file is intended to hold the full 9-panel deep dive for this subsystem, including:  
> - Critical findings  
> - High/Medium/Low findings  
> - Architectural recommendations  
> - Examples (good, bad, legacy)  
> - Reverse-engineered SDK surfaces (where applicable)  

## 1. Role in the System

_TBD — to be filled with a concise description of how this subsystem contributes to the L0 mission._

## 2. Panel Summary (Once Filled)

- Distributed Systems (Elena): _TBD_
- Security (Marcus): _TBD_
- DDD (Ingrid): _TBD_
- Platform (Kenji): _TBD_
- Staff Engineer (Priya): _TBD_
- Database (Omar): _TBD_
- API Design (Sarah): _TBD_
- Devil's Advocate (Rafael): _TBD_
- Strategic/Impact (Victoria): _TBD_

## 3. Critical Findings (Placeholder)

Once analysis is run, document Critical/High items here, each with L0–L4 structure and cross-links into L3/L4 sections.

## 4. Architectural Notes & Invariants

List invariants and constraints that **must** hold true for this subsystem to be healthy.

## 5. Example Patterns

- **Good Pattern Example:** _TBD_
- **Bad Pattern Example:** _TBD_
- **Refactored Pattern:** _TBD_ (often mapped to a new SDK abstraction)

## 6. Open Questions

Track unresolved decisions and design questions.
