# L3 — React Components & Pages

This file catalogs the **concrete components** that make up the system.  
Each entry should be linkable from L2 subsystem files and from L4 task plans.

## 1. Structure

Each component should be documented as:

```text
COMPONENT: [Name]
TYPE: [API route / React component / Function / Collection / etc.]
LOCATION: [Path in repo]
OWNING SUBSYSTEM: [Link to L2 file]
DESCRIPTION: [What it does]
INTERFACES: [Inputs/Outputs]
RISKS: [Known issues]
RELATED TASKS: [Links into 05_TASKS_L4/*]
```

## 2. Catalog

_TBD — to be filled as the codebase is systematically walked._
