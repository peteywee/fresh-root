# Top Shelf Service LLC™ — Brand Guidelines (v1.0)

**Tagline:** The hardest part is done for you.

## 1. Brand Essence

Top Shelf Service LLC™ exists to take the heavy, repetitive operational work off small operators so
they can focus on people and profit.

The logo — a lone figure pushing a massive boulder uphill — represents the invisible, exhausting
labor that your clients do every day. Our promise is simple: **we move the boulder for them.**

## 2. Brand Voice

- Direct, calm, and competent.
- No hype, no jargon, no gimmicks.
- We acknowledge how hard the work is, then clearly show how we remove friction.

### Voice Examples

- “Stop fighting the schedule. The hardest part is done for you.”
- “Less paperwork. Fewer call‑outs. More time on the floor.”
- “From paper to production in a weekend.”

## 3. Logo Usage

- **Primary logo:** full illustration of the figure and boulder. Use on hero sections, print, and
  brand collateral.
- **Icon logo:** simplified square mark cropped from the illustration. Use for app icons and
  favicons.
- Always maintain clear space equal to the height of the figure’s head around the logo.
- Minimum digital size: 64px width for the primary mark.
- Do not distort, recolor, or place the logo on busy photographic backgrounds.

## 4. Color System

Core palette is grayscale with one accent color for calls to action.

- **TS Black** — `#050507`
- **TS Charcoal** — `#181A1F`
- **TS Slate** — `#2C3036`
- **TS Mist** — `#F3F4F6`
- **TS Accent Green** — `#22C55E` (success, confirmation)
- **TS Accent Amber** — `#F59E0B` (warnings, low inventory)
- **TS Accent Red** — `#EF4444` (errors, critical alerts)

Usage:

- Backgrounds: TS Black, TS Charcoal, or TS Mist.
- Primary text: White on dark; TS Slate on light.
- Primary CTAs: TS Accent Green on TS Charcoal backgrounds.
- Warning states: TS Accent Amber.
- Error/destructive: TS Accent Red.

## 5. Typography

Preferred typefaces (both available via Google Fonts):

- **Headlines:** _Montserrat_ (600–800 weight)
- **Body / UI:** _Inter_ (400–600 weight)

Fallback stacks:

- `font-family: "Montserrat", system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif;`
- `font-family: "Inter", system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif;`

## 6. Imagery

- Bias toward black‑and‑white or desaturated photography showing real work: kitchens, line cooks,
  dish pits, managers with clipboards, late‑night cleanup.
- Avoid staged stock photography with overly polished, smiling models.
- When in doubt: choose gritty, honest imagery that looks like real life, not a commercial.

## 7. Tagline Usage

**Primary tagline:** “The hardest part is done for you.”

- Use this in headers, pitch decks, and hero sections.
- Do not alter the wording in primary placements.
- Acceptable secondary lines:
  - “Scheduling without the headache.”
  - “From paper schedules to predictable weeks.”

## 8. Product & Company Lockup

- Legal / company name: **Top Shelf Service LLC™**
- Product name: **Fresh Schedules™** (if/when you brand the app separately)

Example lockup:

> Fresh Schedules™ by Top Shelf Service LLC™\
> The hardest part is done for you.

## 9. Legal Line

Use this in the footer of websites, pitch decks, and PDFs:

> © 2025 Top Shelf Service LLC™. All rights reserved.
