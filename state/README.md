# Repository State & Metrics

This directory contains automatically generated and maintained metrics, quality scores, and repository state information for Fresh Schedules.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Provide real-time view of repository health, quality scores, and compliance metrics
- **Scope**: Production readiness, coverage metrics, quality scorecard, compliance reports
- **Maintenance**: Fully automated by CI/CD (`maintain-docs.yml`, `test-coverage.yml`)
- **Quality**: 10/10 compliance enforced (auto-regenerated)

## Core Areas

### Repository State (Auto-Generated)

- REPO_STATE.md *(generated by CI/CD)* - Current state, health metrics, and compliance summary
- COVERAGE_METRICS.md *(generated by CI/CD)* - Test coverage, code quality, performance metrics
- QUALITY_SCORECARD.md *(generated by CI/CD)* - 10/10 quality score breakdown by domain

### Archival State (Reference)

- PRODUCTION_READINESS.md - Production pre-flight checklist and sign-off
- PRODUCTION_READINESS_KPI.md - Key performance indicators and metrics
- PRODUCTION_READINESS_SIGN_OFF.md - Sign-off verification and approvals
- STATE_INDEX.md - Comprehensive state analysis and index

## Auto-Generated Files

These files are regenerated by CI/CD workflows:

### `REPO_STATE.md` (Generated by `maintain-docs.yml`)

- Repository health status
- Domain directory validation
- Cross-link verification
- Last updated: `<auto>`

### `COVERAGE_METRICS.md` (Generated by `test-coverage.yml`)

- Unit test coverage (%)
- Integration test coverage (%)
- E2E test coverage (%)
- Performance benchmarks
- Last updated: `<auto>`

### `QUALITY_SCORECARD.md` (Generated by both workflows)

- Overall quality score (target: 10/10)
- Domain-by-domain breakdown
- Compliance with hard rules
- Quality gate status
- Last updated: `<auto>`

## CI/CD Maintenance

This directory is maintained by two automated workflows:

**`.github/workflows/maintain-docs.yml`** (On push to main, on PR merge)

- Regenerates REPO_STATE.md
- Validates domain structure
- Updates QUALITY_SCORECARD.md
- Syncs root-level artifacts

**`.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml`** (On push to main, on demand)

- Runs full test suite
- Generates COVERAGE_METRICS.md
- Updates quality breakdown
- Enforces 10/10 quality gates

## Quality Standards

- ✅ Files in `/state/` are automatically maintained
- ✅ All generated files validated for 10/10 quality
- ✅ Cross-references validated (0 broken links)
- ✅ Metrics updated on every major commit
- ✅ Last sync: December 7, 2025

## Interpretation Guide

### Quality Score Legend

- **10/10** - Excellent, all standards met
- **9/10** - Very good, minor issues
- **8/10** - Good, some areas need attention
- **7/10 or below** - CI/CD blocks merge, requires fixes

### Coverage Thresholds

- **Unit tests**: ≥90% required
- **Integration tests**: ≥80% required
- **E2E tests**: ≥70% required
- **Overall**: ≥85% required for 10/10 score
