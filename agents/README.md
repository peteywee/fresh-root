# CREWOPS Protocol: Activation Complete ✅

**Status**: FULLY ACTIVE & READY  
**Date**: December 4, 2025  
**Implementation**: COMPLETE  
**Binding**: Automatic  
**Primary Location**: `docs/crewops/` ← **READ DOCUMENTATION THERE**

---

## 📌 Important: Documentation Moved

All CrewOps protocol documentation has been moved to **`docs/crewops/`** for better organization and accessibility.

**Start here**: [`docs/crewops/README.md`](../docs/crewops/README.md)

---

## 🎉 WHAT'S BEEN ACCOMPLISHED

The **CrewOps Protocol** has been successfully activated and is now ready to dispatch on your next non-trivial request. The protocol is:

- ✅ **Loaded** into the agent context
- ✅ **Self-engaging** on session start + non-trivial prompts
- ✅ **Fail-closed** with enforcement gates
- ✅ **Evidence-driven** with tool verification
- ✅ **Security-first** with Red Team veto authority
- ✅ **Fully documented** with 6 comprehensive files

## 🚀 HOW IT WORKS (Simple Version)

### On Session Start
Protocol automatically loads. You'll see an activation message showing all 6 crew roles are ready.

### On Your Next Question
If your question is "non-trivial" (code, architecture, research, deployment):
1. **Phase A**: Protocol reads your goal + constraints
2. **Phase B+C**: Protocol plans + assembles crew
3. **Phase D**: Protocol executes + gathers evidence
4. **Phase E**: Security Red Team approves or vetos
5. **Validation**: Gates verified, audit trail recorded

All happens automatically. You get back: **working code + commands + validation + audit trail**.

---

## 🎭 YOUR CREW (6 Roles)

When protocol engages:

1. **Orchestrator** — Routes work, arbitrates conflicts
2. **Product Owner** — Defines success criteria
3. **Systems Architect** — Makes design decisions
4. **Security Red Team** — Has VETO power (can block unsafe work)
5. **Research Analyst** — Deploys tools, verifies facts
6. **QA/Test Engineer** — Validates gates, confirms DoD

They self-coordinate per the Constitution (7 binding laws).

---

## 🔐 SECURITY SUPREMACY

The **Security Red Team** can **BLOCK** work if they find:
- Auth bypass risks
- Data leakage risks
- Insecure defaults
- Missing access controls
- Dangerous secret handling

If veto triggered: Work stops in Phase E until fixed. No exceptions.

---

## 🛠️ TOOLS (Automatic Deployment)

When protocol engages:
- **Research Analyst** auto-deploys: `read_file`, `grep_search`, `semantic_search`, `mcp_firecrawl_*`
- **QA Engineer** auto-deploys: `get_errors`, `run_in_terminal`
- **Scribe** auto-deploys: `list_dir`, `mcp_github_*`

**You don't call tools.** They're invoked automatically per role.

---

## 📋 EVIDENCE HIERARCHY (What Proof Means)

Protocol verifies facts in this order:
1. **Tool observation** (highest confidence)
2. **Primary documentation**
3. **Secondary sources**
4. **Assumptions** (labeled `[ASSUMPTION]` with fallback plan)

If a critical assumption can't be verified → protocol blocks and states why.

---

## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE (Before Finalizing)

Task is "done" only when:
- ✅ Commands run locally without error
- ✅ Environment variables defined
- ✅ Output performs stated business action
- ✅ Rollback path exists
- ✅ Security veto passed

Protocol verifies all items before finalizing.

---

## 🔄 THE 5 PHASES (A→E, Always)

Every non-trivial request executes:

**Phase A: CONTEXT SATURATION**
- Read files, constraints, goals
- Verify assumptions with tools
- Output: "Context Loaded" + "Risks Identified"

**Phase B+C: PLANNING + TEAM**
- Decompose into batches
- Spawn workers per batch
- Assign Constitutional clauses
- Output: Batch structure + assignments

**Phase D: ACTION MATRIX**
- Execute line-by-line
- Deploy tools automatically
- Gather evidence
- Output: Code + commands + artifacts

**Phase E: SECURITY VETO + REFLEXION**
- Red Team veto check
- Reconcile constraints
- State what changed and why
- Output: Veto pass/block + refinements

**VALIDATION GATES**
- Green gates verified
- DoD confirmed
- Audit trail complete

## 💡 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS (For Customization)

Add any of these to your prompt:

```
CREWOPS_OK              # Acknowledge binding (recommended first prompt)
CREWOPS_DESIGN_ONLY     # Plan only (no code)
CREWOPS_AUDIT           # Find problems (no fixes)
CREWOPS_EXECUTE         # Run pre-planned (Phase D only)
CREWOPS_EMERGENCY       # Fast-track (minimal planning)
```

Example:
```
I need a security audit for the payment flow.
CREWOPS_AUDIT
```

## 🎯 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

Your next non-trivial request will trigger:

```
✅ CREWOPS PROTOCOL ENGAGED

🏷️ CONTEXT INTAKE
🧠 CREW ASSEMBLY  
⚡ SWARM PROTOCOL INITIATION
📋 GATES ENGAGED

📖 PHASE A: CONTEXT SATURATION
Context Loaded: [summary]
Risks Identified: X

🧠 PHASE B+C: PLAN & TEAM
Batch 1: [scope] → [SPAWNING WORKER]: Name
Batch 2: [scope] → [SPAWNING WORKER]: Name

⚡ PHASE D: ACTION MATRIX
[x] Action 1 → [tool] → [result]
[x] Action 2 → [tool] → [result]

🛡️ PHASE E: SECURITY VETO
Red Team: ✅ Veto passed

✅ VALIDATION GATES
[x] Gate 1 → pass
[x] Gate 2 → pass
```

Everything is automatic. You just see it unfold.

---

## ✨ YOU'RE READY
