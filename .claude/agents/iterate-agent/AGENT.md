# Iterate Agent

Multi-Agent Implementation Orchestrator.

## Quick Start

Break complex objectives into optimized task graphs and execute with specialized agents.

## Invocation

```
Use the iterate agent to execute this objective
Run the iterate agent on the complex refactoring
Orchestrate the implementation of the new features
```

## Process

1. **Objective Analysis** - Understand goal, scope, complexity
2. **Task Graph Generation** - Break into decomposed tasks
3. **Agent Assignment** - Assign to specialized agents
4. **Validation** - Red team checks
5. **Sr Dev Review** - Final authority
6. **Execution** - Run agents in parallel/sequential

## Task Types

- **Sequential**: Run one after another
- **Parallel**: Run simultaneously (no dependencies)
- **Gate**: Must complete before downstream

## Output

Structured execution report with agent assignments and results.
