## Best Practices

1. **PR Titles**: Use conventional commits format
2. **Descriptions**: Include summary, test plan, and related issues
3. **Size**: Keep PRs focused (<400 lines when possible)
4. **Reviews**: Address all comments before merge
5. **Merge Strategy**: Default to squash for clean history
6. **Branch Naming**: Enforce repository branch naming conventions

## Branch Naming Conventions

**Pattern**: `{type}/{ticket}-{description}`

**Types**:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `feature` | New functionality | `feature/FS-123-add-time-off` |
| `fix` | Bug fixes | `fix/FS-456-schedule-calc` |
| `refactor` | Code improvement | `refactor/FS-789-cleanup` |
| `chore` | Maintenance | `chore/update-deps` |
| `hotfix` | Emergency fix | `hotfix/FS-999-auth-bypass` |

**Validation Regex**:

```
^(feature|fix|refactor|chore|hotfix)\/[A-Z]+-[0-9]+-[a-z0-9-]+$|^(feature|fix|refactor|chore)\/[a-z0-9-]+$
```
