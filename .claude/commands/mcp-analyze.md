Use the MCP server to analyze the current project structure and health:

1. Get the repository index to understand the overall structure
2. List the main source directories (apps, packages, tools)
3. Search for TODO and FIXME comments
4. Run typecheck to check for type errors
5. Run lint to check for code quality issues
6. Provide a summary report with:
   - Project structure overview
   - Number of TODO/FIXME items found
   - Any type errors
   - Any lint issues
   - Recommendations for improvements
