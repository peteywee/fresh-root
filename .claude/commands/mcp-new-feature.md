Guide me through adding a new feature to the project:

1. Ask me what feature I want to add
2. Use fs_list to show me where similar features exist
3. Use fs_read_file to read relevant example files
4. Use fs_create_file to create the necessary files for the new feature
5. Use fs_create_test to generate tests
6. Use fs_run to run typecheck and verify the code compiles
7. Use fs_update_index to update the repository index
8. Provide a summary of what was created and next steps
