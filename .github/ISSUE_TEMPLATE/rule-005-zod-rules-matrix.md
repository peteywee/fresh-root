## Objective

Guarantee **data correctness** and **tenant isolation** with Zod validation and robust rules tests.

## Scope

- Collections: `orgs, memberships, positions, schedules, shifts`.

## Deliverables

- `packages/types/src/*.ts` final schemas + invariants.
- `services/api/src/validators/*.ts`
- `tests/rules/*.test.ts` expanded matrix.

## Tasks

- [ ] Finalize schemas (required fields, time ranges, overlap constraints).
- [ ] API validates all writes (422 with details on failure).
- [ ] Add ≥3 denial tests per collection (wrong role, cross-org, missing fields).
- [ ] Keep CI rules suite green.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Invalid payload ⇒ **422** with pointer messages.
- Cross-org denial paths covered.

## KPIs

- 0 policy regressions in rules test coverage.

## Definition of Done

- PR merged with coverage evidence.
