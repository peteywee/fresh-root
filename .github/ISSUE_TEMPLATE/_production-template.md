## Labels

- P*:
- Area:

## Objective

Explain why this matters for production readiness.

## Scope

**In:**
**Out:**

## Files / Paths

- path/to/file ‚Äì description

## Commands

```bash
# deterministic steps
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ]

## Success KPIs

## Definition of Done

- [ ] CI green
- [ ] Docs updated
- [ ] Tests ‚â• 85 %
- [ ] Security audit clear
- [ ] Linked in roadmap
- [ ] All lint/format errors auto-fixed before commit/PR (any language)

## Explanation / Rationale

Why this task exists, dependencies, and production impact.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Why This Ties Directly to Production Readiness

| Capability | Enabled By | Effect |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **Reproducibility** | Commands + Files + Scope | ‚ÄúWorks on my machine‚Äù eliminated |
| **Traceability** | Labels + Paths + Rationale | Audit trail & postmortem evidence |
| **Observability Maturity** | KPIs + DoD | Links code output ‚Üí SLO targets |
| **Automation** | Labels + AC | GitHub Actions can parse and gate |
| **Governance** | DoD + CI + Docs | Enforces ‚ÄúAll Green Before You Push‚Äù |

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Meta Acceptance Criteria (for this framework itself)

- [x] Every future response must include **Labels, Objective, Scope, Files/Paths, Commands, Acceptance Criteria, Success KPIs, Definition of Done**.
- [x] Template stored in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/_production-template.md`.
- [x] GitHub Actions validate presence of these sections (optional extension).

---

### ‚úÖ Definition of Done (for this framework)

- This framework is documented and committed.
- It governs every subsequent answer.
- Missing any section = invalid response.
- The repo can generate a new ticket or deliverable from this template automatically.

Would you like me to now generate the **`.github/workflows/validate-template.yml`** that automatically fails CI if any PR description or issue lacks these required headings? That turns this philosophy into enforceable policy.

| Section | Why it must exist |
|---|---|
| Labels | Drive automation, dashboards, CI gating, and triage visibility. Missing labels block workflow metrics. |
| Objective | Defines ‚Äúwhy this work matters.‚Äù Prevents scope creep and misaligned effort. |
| Scope | Prevents accidental coupling or half-baked integrations. |
| Files / Paths | Enables deterministic rebuilds and traceable file history. |
| Commands | Ensures reproducibility on any system or CI runner. |
| Acceptance Criteria | Converts subjective ‚Äúdone‚Äù into binary truth. |
| Success KPIs | Translates engineering work into measurable ops impact. |
| Definition of Done | Locks delivery gates: tests, docs, security, and CI states. |
| Explanation / Rationale | Captures architectural intent for future maintainers and audits. |

#### Acceptance Benchmarks (Global Defaults)

Unless overridden in a specific issue:

- CI: must pass lint, typecheck, unit, and integration suites.
- Docs: must be updated or linked in docs/.
- Coverage: ‚â• 85 % for critical paths.
- Runtime health: p95 latency < 250 ms for API, < 2.5 s TTI for web.
- Security: 0 critical/high vulnerabilities on pnpm audit.
- Rollbacks: tested and documented for release work.
